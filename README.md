# Lucky Warp
This iPad game was released in 2011 and is no longer available in the App Store. 

Escape a tower full of mazes by running, jumping and teleporting to each level's exit.

The game utilizes several existing libraries:

* *Cocos2D for iOS. This library, in turn, uses OpenGL ES to render its graphics.*

* *SneakyJoystick, a joystick library written for Cocos2D using Objective-C*
   
   * *SneakyJoystickSkinnedBase, a visual skin for the SneakyJoystick class.*

* *SimpleAudioEngine, a simple 2-channel audio library for Cocos2D.*

Where there is example code from other sources, it is noted in each files' comments.

*Developed by:*

Albith R. Delgado: *game design, programming, sound effects.*

Pablo Pimentel: *game art & animation.*

Josue Gonzales Rivera: *music & sound effects.*
